`District` table is used to verify the validation of the registered user's ID card number. `database_storage` table stores the size and percentage of each table in the database. `capacity` table stores the maximum seat number of each carriage on one train. This database contains the full stations and trains information of China railway (excluding the additional carriages on holiday).
